This repository contains tasks I took on during the Alx program. The scripts are based on the following C conceepts:

Automatic and dynamic allocation
Dynamic memory allocation in C - malloc calloc realloc free
valgrind

I now understand the following:
What is the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation
What is malloc and free and how to use them
Why and when use malloc
How to use valgrind to check for memory leak
