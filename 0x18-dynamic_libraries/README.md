This repository contains tasks I took on during the Alx program. The scripts are based on the following C conceepts:

What is difference between Dynamic and Static library 
Creating dynamic libraries on Linux

I now know the answer to the following: What is a dynamic library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it?
What is the environment variable $LD_LIBRARY_PATH and how to use it?
What are the differences between static and shared libraries?
Basic usage nm, ldd, ldconfig?
