C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

This repository contains tasks I took on during the Alx program. The scripts are based on the following C conceepts:

Pointers and arrays
C - Pointer to Pointer
C  Pointer to Pointer with example
Multi-dimensional Arrays in C
Two dimensional (2D) arrays in C programming with example

I now know the anwer to the below questions:
What are pointers to pointers and how to use them?
What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them?
What are the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings?
