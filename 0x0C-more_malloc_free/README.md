C - More malloc, free
This repository contains tasks I took on during the Alx program. The scripts are based on the following C conceepts:
Casting the result of malloc
exit (3)
calloc
realloc

I now know the answer to the below questions:
How to use the exit function
What are the functions calloc and realloc from the standard library and how to use them
