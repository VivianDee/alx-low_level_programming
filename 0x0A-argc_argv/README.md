C - argc, argv
This repository contains tasks I took on during the Alx program. The scripts are based on the following C conceepts:

Arguments to main
argc and argv
What does argc and argv mean?
how to compile with unused variables

I now know the answer to the below questions:
How to use arguments passed to your program
What are two prototypes of main that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
How to use __attribute__((unused)) or (void) to compile functions with unused variables or parameters
