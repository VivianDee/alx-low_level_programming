C - Variadic functions

This repository contains tasks I took on during the Alx program. The scripts are based on the following C concepts:

stdarg.h
Variadic Functions
Const Keyword

I now know the following:
What are variadic functions
How to use va_start, va_arg and va_end macros
Why and how to use the const type qualifier
