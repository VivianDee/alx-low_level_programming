This repository contains tasks I took on during the Alx program. The scripts are based on the following C conceepts:

Function Pointer in C
Pointers to functions
Function Pointers in C / C++
why pointers to functions?
Everything you need to know about pointers in C


I now know the following:

What are function pointers and how to use them
What does a function pointer exactly hold
Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory
