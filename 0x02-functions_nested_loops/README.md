C - Functions, nested loops

This repository contains tasks I took on during the Alx program. The scripts are based on the following C conceepts:

Nested while loops
C - Functions
Learning to Program in C
function prototype
C - Header Files
gcc flags -Wall, -Werror, -pedantic, -Wextra, and -std=gnu89

I now know the anwer to the below questions:

What are nested loops and how to use them?
What is a function and how do you use functions?
What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function?
What is a prototype?
Scope of variables?
What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89?
What are header files and how to to use them with #include?
